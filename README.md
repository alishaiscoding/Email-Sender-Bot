What have I programmed?

The code is designed to send an email using the Mailgun API, a third-party email service provider. It uses something called the Mailgun service to do this.

Mailgun API is a tool provided by Mailgun that allows developers to send and receive emails from their applications using code. It helps developers to easily integrate email functionality into their applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. It provides various features to ensure that the emails are delivered reliably and efficiently.


Why did I build it?

I created an email sender bot for my first job, automating thank you emails to customers and saving valuable time. In my second job as a teaching assistant, I utilized the bot to send timely notifications to parents about deadlines, streamlining communication. The bot proved versatile and efficient in both roles, enhancing operations and improving customer and parent satisfaction.
